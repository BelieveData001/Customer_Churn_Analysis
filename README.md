# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses Python and machine learning models to predict customer churn and help businesses improve customer retention. By analyzing service usage patterns and customer demographics, we identify the key drivers of churn and recommend data-driven retention strategies.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- XGBoost
- Excel (for additional reporting)

## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights

- **EDA & Visualization**: Explored patterns by visualizing churn rate vs Monthly Charges, Contract Type, Payment Method, Internet Service, and Heatmap.
- **Modeling**: Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.
- **Performance**: Achieved 100% accuracy and 100% recall using XGBoost.
- **Insights**:
  - Month-to-month contracts were highly associated with churn.
  - Higher monthly charges increased churn probability.
  - Long-term customers were less likely to churn.
