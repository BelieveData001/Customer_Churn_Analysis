# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses Python and machine learning models to predict customer churn and help businesses improve customer retention. By analyzing service usage patterns and customer demographics, we identify the key drivers of churn and recommend data-driven retention strategies.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Tableau
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- XGBoost
- Excel (for additional reporting)
